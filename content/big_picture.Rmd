## Who's working in tech?

According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.cyberstates.org/), there are an estimated 12.4 million workers in information technology in the U.S. The industry is lucrative, and expanding. Technology companies account for 10% of the nation's economy. The output of tech companies has greatly changed the ways in which we communicate, create, share, and play, in ways particularly palpable and beneficial during the covid-19 pandemic, which has digitized our once physical school, work, and social lives.

But who's actually working in tech? Are perceptions of tech as a young and male dominated endeavor true? And what is the landscape of physical and mental health in these tech workers? We look into some of these answers, using data collected in the 2016 and 2018 [Open Sourcing Mental Illness Mental Health in Tech Surveys](https://osmihelp.org/research).

## Demographics

### Where are the tech workers working? 

Most of the respondents in both the 2016 and 2018 survey are working in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom. The following are the ten most common countries to work in tech, in descending order, reported in 2016 on the left, and 2018 on the right. The top four most popular countries to work in tech are the same in both years, but in 2018, there are the additions of Poland and India in the top ten.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Rank | Country of work (2016) | Count | &nbsp; | Country of work (2018) | Count |
| --- | --- | ----------- | -- | --- | ----------- |
| 1 | USA | 851 | &nbsp; | USA | 312 | 
| 2 | UK | 185 | &nbsp; | UK | 19 | 
| 3 | Canada | 74 | &nbsp; | Canada | 8 | 
| 4 | Germany | 58 | &nbsp; | Germany | 7 | 
| 5 | Netherlands | 47 | &nbsp; | Poland | 6 | 
| 6 | Australia | 34 | &nbsp; | India | 5 | 
| 7 | Sweden | 20 | &nbsp; | Netherlands | 5 | 
| 8 | Ireland | 15 | &nbsp; | Australia | 4 | 
| 9 | France | 14 | &nbsp; | France | 4 | 
| 10 | Brazil | 10 | &nbsp; | Italy | 4 | 

### Is there diversity in tech?

Although many more workers responded to the survey in 2018 than 2016, the pattern of gender breakdowns in both years is similar: tech workers are predominantly male.

When we take in addition the consideration of age, we see most tech workers, across genders and across survey years, are relatively young, between 25-40 years old.

Why are there so few women in tech? Identifying and remedying dropout points, whether in encouraging early school STEM education in women and nonbinary individuals, in encouraging these underrepresented groups to study computer science in college and beyond, and encouraging workspace diversity and especially diversity in senior leadership, may help close the gender gap in tech. 

## Mental health in tech workers

We assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in tech workers. Of the respondents, 441 (23.8%) report having an ongoing mental health disorder, whereas many more individuals 949 (50.8%) report having had a mental health disorder in the past. This may be due to selection bias, in which individuals with acute, ongoing mental health disorders would less likely be reponsive to such a survey or currently employed in the tech industry.

These estimates of mental health prevalence in tech workers are higher than [global estimates](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#eating-disorders), in which the prevalence of ongoing mental health disorders of any kind is projected to be around one in ten people (10.7%), or 792 million individuals worldwide. As stated by the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination), stigma against mental health, at the institutional and individually internalized levels, are very much prevalent, and so surveys of these kinds may underestimate the true number of individuals struggling. 

## Stigma and mental health 
We further investigate the stigma surrounding mental health in the tech workplace. How strongly stigmatized is it? Has stigma evolved over time as the topic of mental health has garnered more attention? Does it vary between demographic groups? In order to uncover potential answers to these interesting questions, we developed a quantitative, overall measure of stigma for each survey participant: we called this metric the “stigma score.”

<p>&nbsp;</p>

To generate this score, we quantified the responses to four questions related to stigma, then summed to arrive at an overall stigma score per respondent. The higher the numerical score, the greater the stigma we deemed surrounding mental health for that individual. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The questions we used to determined the stigma score were: 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

+ [1] How difficult is it for you to ask for mental health related medical leave?
+ [2] How comfortable are you in discussing mental health with a coworker? 
+ [3] How comfortable are you in discussing mental health with supervisors?
+ [4] Are you willing to bring up mental health in an interview? 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

With this metric, we evaluated trends in stigma by gender and across time. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Overall, our analysis seemed to show that the distributions of stigma remained largely the same per gender between 2016 and 2018; if anything, the distribution for females and gender-queer/non-binary individuals seemed to have move slightly toward a lower stigma distribution between the two years. After calculating the average stigma scores per gender per year, these original observations seemed confirmed: the average scores slightly decreased for both female and gender-queer/non-binary respondents between 2016 and 2018, yet remained about the same for males.

## Mental health and family history 

As mental health has a genetic component, we ask: does a family history of mental health disorder predict a respondent's own presence of a mental health disorder?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

More respondents reported having a family history of mental disorder than not. Compellingly, we find one's own mental health is strongly related to the mental health history of family members, such that individuals with a high family history of mental health disorder are more likely of having a mental health disorder themselves. In red is the trend line, or the straight line that best models the relationship one's own and one's family's mental health. The data here supports the idea of a hereditary component or genetic susceptibility in mental health.

## An interactive look at demographics and stigma

For a more in-depth, high-level view of mental health in tech, we recommend checking out our [interactive dashboard](/flex/flex.html). It further explores attitudes towards mental and physical health, prevalence of mental health diseases among tech workers and possible stigma through interactive graphs and tables that are both informative and fun to play with! 

## How to protect mental health 

According to the [NIH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/genetics-and-mental-disorders-report-of-the-national-institute-of-mental-healths-genetics-workgroup#toc-i), the annual cost to the U.S. for treatment, social service, lost productivity, and related costs to mental health issues is more than $150 billion. Improving mental health lowers not only these monetary costs, but more importantly, the costs to well-being of workers in tech and the companies they work for. We've identified some potential factors for improving mental health in the tech workplace: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
+ Increasing diversity and decreasing ageism 
+ Lowering mental health stigma, so employees feel as comfortable discussing mental health issues as physical health ones, and employees feel comfortable asking for mental health related medical leave
+ Recognizing the genetic susceptibility of mental health disorders, and providing extra support if signs of poor mental health are observed

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Sensitivity to such factors may improve the quality of the tech workspace and prevent mental health illness in its workers.
