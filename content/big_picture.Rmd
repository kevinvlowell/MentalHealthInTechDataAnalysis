# Who's working in tech?

According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.cyberstates.org/), there are an estimated 12.4 million workers in information technology in the U.S. The industry is lucrative, and expanding. Technology companies account for 10% of the nation's economy. The output of tech companies has greatly changed the ways in which we communicate, create, share, and play, in ways particularly palpable and beneficial during the covid-19 pandemic, which has digitized our once physical school, work, and social lives.

But who's actually working in tech? Are perceptions of tech as a young and male dominated endeavor true? And what is landscape of physical and mental health in these tech workers? We look into some of these answers, using data collected in the 2016 and 2018 [Open Sourcing Mental Illness Mental Health in Tech Surveys](https://osmihelp.org/research).

## Demographics

### Where are the tech workers working? 

Most of the respondents in both the 2016 and 2018 survey are working in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom. The following are the ten most common countries to work in tech, in descending order, reported in 2016 on the left, and 2018 on the right. The top four most popular countries to work in tech are the same in both years, but in 2018, there are the additions of Poland and India in the top ten.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Rank | Country of work (2016) | Count | &nbsp; | Country of work (2018) | Count |
| --- | --- | ----------- | -- | --- | ----------- |
| 1 | USA | 851 | &nbsp; | USA | 312 | 
| 2 | UK | 185 | &nbsp; | UK | 19 | 
| 3 | Canada | 74 | &nbsp; | Canada | 8 | 
| 4 | Germany | 58 | &nbsp; | Germany | 7 | 
| 5 | Netherlands | 47 | &nbsp; | Poland | 6 |

| 9 | France | 14 | &nbsp; | France | 4 | 
| 10 | Brazil | 10 | &nbsp; | Italy | 4 | 

### Is there diversity in tech?

Although many more workers responded to the survey in 2018 than 2016, the pattern of gender breakdowns in both years is similar: tech workers are predominantly male.

When we take in addition the consideration of age, we see most tech workers, across genders and across survey years, are relatively young, between 25-40 years old.

Why are there so few women in tech? Identifying and remedying dropout points, whether in encouraging early school STEM education in women and nonbinary individuals, in encouraging these underrepresented groups to study computer science in college and beyond, and encouraging workspace diversity and especially diversity in senior leadership, may help close the gender gap in tech. 

## Mental health in tech workers

We assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in tech workers. Of the respondents, 441 (23.8%) report having an ongoing mental health disorder, whereas many more individuals 949 (50.8%) report having had a mental health disorder in the past. This may be due to selection bias, in which individuals with acute, ongoing mental health disorders would less likely be reponsive to such a survey or currently employed in the tech industry.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

These estimates of mental health prevalence in tech workers are higher than [global estimates](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#eating-disorders), in which the prevalence of ongoing mental health disorders of any kind is projected to be around one in ten people (10.7%), or 792 million individuals worldwide. As stated by the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination), stigma against mental health, at the institutional and individaully internalized levels, are very much prevalent concerns, and so surveys of these kinds may underestimate the true number of individuals struggling. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

As mental health has a genetic component, we ask: does a family history of mental health disorder predict prevalence of an ongoing mental disorder?

## Stigma and mental health 
In addition, one of the topics that we wanted to explore in depth was the stigma surrounding mental health in the tech workplace. How strongly stigmatized or not stigmatized is it? Has stigma evolved over time as the topic of mental health has garnered more attention? Does it vary between demographic groups? In order to uncover potential answers to these interesting questions, we sought to generate some quantitative, overall measure of stigma for each survey participant: we called this metric the “stigma score.”
To generate a stigma score for each participant, we quantified the responses to several questions whose responses were indicative of stigma, and summed the scores of each of these questions together to get an overall stigma score. The higher the numerical score, the greater we deemed the stigma surrounding mental health was for that individual. As an example, the survey question “"Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health issue with your coworkers?" allowed survey participants to choose from the responses “Yes,” “Maybe,” and “No.” Each of these responses was recoded to values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
With a rough overall measure of stigma calculated, we were able to produce some interesting visuals and trends regarding the distributions of stigma per gender per year:
INSERT VISUALS
Overall, our analysis seemed to show that the distributions of stigma remained largely the same per gender between 2016 and 2018; if anything, the distribution for females and gender-queer/non-binary individuals seemed to have move slightly toward a lower stigma distribution between the two years. After calculating the average stigma scores per gender per year, these original observations seemed confirmed: the average scores slightly decreased for both female and gender-queer/non-binary respondents between 2016 and 2018, yet remained about the same for males.

## Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex_Sussman.html).

Making our own interactive dashboard now [here](/flex/flex.html). 


Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.


## Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
