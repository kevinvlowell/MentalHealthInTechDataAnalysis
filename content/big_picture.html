<h1>Who’s working in tech?</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cyberstates.org/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, there are an estimated 12.4 million workers in information technology in the U.S. The industry is lucrative, and expanding. Technology companies account for 10% of the nation’s economy. The output of tech companies has greatly changed the ways in which we communicate, create, share, and play, in ways particularly palpable and beneficial during the covid-19 pandemic, which has digitized our once physical school, work, and social lives.</p>

</p>
<p>But who’s actually working in tech? Are perceptions of tech as a young and male dominated endeavor true? And what is landscape of physical and mental health in these tech workers? We look into some of these answers, using data collected in the 2016 and 2018 <a href="https://osmihelp.org/research">Open Sourcing Mental Illness Mental Health in Tech Surveys</a>.</p>

<h3>Where are the tech workers working?</h3>
Most of the respondents in both the 2016 and 2018 survey are working in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom. The following countries are the ten most common countries to work in tech, in descending order, reported in 2016 on the left, and 2018 on the right. The top four most popular countries to work in tech are the same in both years, but in 2018, there are the additions of Poland and India in the top ten.<br />

<h3>What are the ages and genders?</h3>
<p>Although many more workers responded to the survey in 2018 than 2016, the pattern of gender breakdowns in both years is similar: tech workers are predominantly male.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p><img src="/images/Gender.png" /></p>
<p>When we take in addition the consideration of age, we see most tech workers, across genders and across survey years, are relatively young, between 25-40 years old.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p><img src="/images/Age-Gender.png" /></p>
<p>Why are there so few women in tech? Identifying and remedying dropout points, whether in encouraging early school STEM education in women and nonbinary individuals, in encouraging these underrepresented groups to study computer science in college and beyond, and encouraging workspace diversity and especially diversity in senior leadership, may help close the gender gap in tech.</p>

<p>You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like <a href="/flex/flex_Sussman.html">this one</a>.</p>

<li>Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
=======
<p>Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.</p>

Does it enhance and reinforce your conlusions from the Big Picture?

<div id="video-recording" class="section level2">
<h2>Video Recording</h2>
<p>Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.</p>
