<p>Our first analysis reveals <em>1433</em> participants, with the mean age of <em>34.29</em> from <em>53</em> countries all over the world. The majority works in a tech company or an organization (<em>79.9%</em>).<br />
We also take a look at mental health diagnosis for the participants. <em>46.8%</em> have a family with history of mental disorder, <em>49.9%</em> were diagnosed by a professional, and <em>40.1%</em> currently suffering with a mental health problem. It is surprising to see such large population with mental health diagnosis, but this will help on our analysis of mental health within the tech company.</p>
<p>Only <em>37.1%</em> of the company have mental health benefits in their healthcare coverage, and only <em>21.4%</em> aware of the options available.
<em>29.0%</em> not willing to discuss mental health with previous employers, <em>32.3%</em> feels like mental health is not treat as a physical health issues, and <em>31.0%</em> seen some of their co-workers experiencing negative consequences for their health problems. Overall, there is still limited resources and strong available for mental health problem and strong stigma within the tech company.</p>
