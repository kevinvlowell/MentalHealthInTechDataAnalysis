Above is a summary of the self-reported prevalence of mental health problems. There are 4 categories among the employees:   
1. People without mental health disorder.   
2. People who develop mental health disorder during the time of survey.    
3. People with mental health disorder and is cured of.    
4. People who continue having mental health disorder.     
  
What is important to notice here is the changes among the diagnosis. Since we spend around 1/3 of our time at work, this changes can be attribute partially to the environment in workplace.   
  
### Working environment :  
Among the survey questions, we select a few constructive ideas on how to improve working environments. The list of selected questions for this analysis will be provide below. Then we perform an Chi square test of independence among these categorical data.   
  
The results show that workplaces where employers provide mental health as part of healthcare coverage is associated with a change in mental health diagnosis (p=*0.041*). A formal discussion on mental health at workplace also related to these changes (p=*.050*). It's important to look at what is effective in improving working environment to further assist their workers.   
  
List of questions:  
1. Does your employer provide mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage?  
2. Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?  
3. Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help?  
4. If a mental health issue prompted you to request a medical leave from work, how easy or difficult would it be to ask for that leave?  
5. Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health issue with your coworkers?  
6.  Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health issue with your supervisor?
