We continue exploring our dataset, to get a better grasp of demographics and attitudes towards mental health. 

### Do employers provide mental health healthcare?

More employees report mental health benefits are provided `37%` as opposed to not provided `15%`; however, many employees are uncertain if mental health benefits are covered as part of healthcare coverage. 

### What proportion of respondents are self-employed?

Most (`80%`) of the survey respondents are not self employed.
