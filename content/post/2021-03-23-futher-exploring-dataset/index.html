<p>We continue exploring our dataset, to get a better grasp of demographics and attitudes towards mental and phsyical health. Later, it will be interesting to compare attitudes towards mental and physical by demographics and employment type.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-sample-age-demographics" class="section level3">
<h3>What are the sample age demographics?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Fig_age.png" /></p>
<p>The respondents are relatively young, with a mean around 30 years of age.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-proportion-of-respondents-are-self-employed" class="section level3">
<h3>What proportion of respondents are self-employed?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Fig_selfEmployed.png" /></p>
<p>Most (<code>80%</code>) of the survey respondents are not self employed.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-employers-provide-mental-health-healthcare" class="section level3">
<h3>Do employers provide mental health healthcare?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Fig_MHbenefits.png" /></p>
<p>More employees report mental health benefits are provided <code>37%</code> as opposed to not provided <code>15%</code>; however, many employees are uncertain if mental health benefits are covered as part of healthcare coverage.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-employee-perceptions-of-employer-attitudes-towards-physical-health" class="section level3">
<h3>What are employee perceptions of employer attitudes towards physical health?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Fig_physical.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-employee-perceptions-of-employer-attitudes-towards-mental-health" class="section level3">
<h3>What are employee perceptions of employer attitudes towards mental health?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Fig_mental.png" /></p>
<p>It seems interesting that more employees think discussing mental health issues with their employer would have negative consequences than discussing physical health issues, which suggests there may be workplace stigma in discussing mental health. As this OSMI Mental Health in Tech survey has been conducted annally from 2014 to present, we will later be able to compare these attitudes across years.</p>
