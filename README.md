# Grade

90/100

## Data Page

12/12 points

* Describe where/how to find data.(3pt)

3/3

* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. (3pt)

3/3

* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data. (3pt)

3/3

* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page (3pt)

3/3

## EDA Page(s)

26/33 points


* Introduce what motivates your EDA (3pt)

3/3

* Breadth of the EDA (3pt)

I like how you started by exploring the demographics to put things in context.

3/3


* Depth of the EDA (5pt)

Good but it would be good to try to bring together the different ideas you had.

4.5/5

* Modeling and Inference (5 pt)

When modeling it might make sense to combine the 2016 and 2018 data and include effects for year.

The model with family history really shouldn't be linear model. It makes more sense to just look at the proportions and maybe try a Fisher exact test.

3.5/5

* Clarity Figures (8pt)

There seem to be some missing plots and tables ?

5/8

* Clarity of Explanations (6pt)

Nice.

6/6


* Organization and cleanliness. (3pt)

Your .Rmd files should have running R code, not just comments.

1/3


## Big Picture Page

28/30 points

This page should have no code visible, i.e. use echo=FALSE.

* Title (2pt)


2/2

* Clarity of Explanation (10pt)

Really nice.

10/10

* Quality of Figures (10pt)

Generally good but I would avoid histograms. Also, the logistic regression plots are a little confusing.

It would have been better to keep just the simpler plots.

8/10


* Creativity (10pt)

Cool, and I like the way you brought things back how the data analysis can be used to improve well being.

8/8


## Interactive component and Video

16/17 points

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components. (10pt)

I like it. The table is a little wide so hard to see everything. It would have been nice to filter in more specific ways.

9/10


* Video Recording (7 pt)

7/7
